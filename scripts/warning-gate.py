"""Hold the compiler's diagnostics against a baseline that survives a compiler
that is not the one CI runs, and that can tell OUR warnings from a header's.

Counting is by the [-Wname] tag, never by the message text: diagnostics are
localised, and on the machine that wrote this they read
`warning: напомена више редова [-Wcomment]`. The job exports LC_ALL=C anyway,
but a gate that only works when someone remembers to is not a gate.

WHY THE PARTITION IS OVER THE WHOLE BLOCK
-----------------------------------------
Counting by category alone cannot tell a diagnostic raised inside a standard
header from one raised in our own code that the compiler happened to report at
the same line. Four diagnostics here today are the second-hand kind: GCC inlines
a variant reset entirely inside libstdc++ and loses track of where the buffer
came from, so the primary location is new_allocator.h and the whole chain is
`std::`. Adding that category to the baseline would accept it everywhere; a real
invalid free of one of our own objects reports the SAME primary location,
because operator delete for a member vector is always called from there, and
would land in a category the baseline already excuses.

So a block is partitioned by every frame it names -- the primary location, each
`inlined from ... at`, each `required from` and `note:` -- and it is OURS unless
not one of those frames resolves inside the repository. `project` is the default;
`system` has to be proved.

The translation unit being compiled is NOT one of those frames, deliberately, and
neither is the `In file included from` chain, which starts in that same
translation unit: measured over a full build, all four of GCC 16's
-Wfree-nonheap-object blocks have every inlined frame inside
/usr/include/c++/16 and our own headers only in the include chain, so counting
that chain would make all four `project` and the partition would decide nothing.
The unit is always ours; the chain always begins there. Both are recorded in the
reason instead, so a system
block still says which of our files triggered it.

A `system` entry also has to carry a reason, keyed by (category, primary
location) rather than by category: the same tag from a different header is a
different claim and has to earn its own line. Reasons print on every pass, the
way the coverage ratchet prints its exception.

The anti-vacuum rule is the one that matters most. A zero from an incremental
ninja build means nothing was recompiled, not that nothing warned; that is the
same class as a stale binary passing a test filter, and it has cost this project
real time. A log with fewer compile lines than the baseline expects is refused,
not scored.

Falling BELOW the baseline never fails the build -- a gate that punishes fixing
warnings does not survive contact -- it prints `stale baseline, run --update`.

Usage:
  ci/scripts/warning-gate.py --check [--require-key] [--leg <name>] <build.log> --build-dir <dir>
  ci/scripts/warning-gate.py --update [--leg <name>] <build.log> --build-dir <dir>

--leg is for a workflow that builds one compiler in more than one configuration
(a matrix): each configuration compiles a different set of units, so each gets
its own section, keyed `<compiler>/<leg>`. Without it the key is the compiler
alone. There is no fallback from one to the other: a union of two legs would let
each leg carry the other's diagnostics, and a leg with no section of its own is
not judged by somebody else's.

--require-key is for CI: without it an unknown compiler key is reported and the
run passes, which is how this check came to judge nothing at all on a runner
whose compiler the baseline had never seen.

Exit codes:
  0  at or below the baseline for this compiler in both partitions
  1  a category grew, appeared, or a system category has no recorded reason;
     or --require-key was given and this compiler has no baseline
  2  refusing to judge: no baseline, no build dir, a log that is not a
     measurement, or a tagged diagnostic with no location to resolve
