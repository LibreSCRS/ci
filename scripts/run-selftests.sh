# run-selftests.sh -- run every self-test this repository ships, and make each
# one say what it measured.
#
# Property, not proxy: a self-test nothing executes proves the same as no
# self-test at all, and a runner that only reads exit codes accepts `exit 0` as
# a body. So this asks two things of every self-test:
#
#   * it exits 0, and
#   * its last line of stdout is    selftest: <n> cases, <r> red-proved
#     with n > 0 and r > 0, where r counts the cases in which the GATE returned
#     non-zero on a perturbed input. A proof that never saw the gate fail is a
#     claim about the gate's happy path.
#
# The set is chosen by pathspec rather than by a list here: a self-test that
# lands outside the scanned paths is invisible to the runner, and the wiring
# check asks this script -- with --list -- what it would execute and compares
# that against what the repository ships. Two copies of the pathspec, one here
# and one there, so a narrowed pathspec is a failure rather than a silence.
#
# Interpreter by extension, never a guess: a Python self-test run under bash
# prints a syntax error and exits non-zero, which reads as a failing gate
# rather than a mis-run one. An extension with no interpreter is exit 2.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/run-selftests.sh           run them all
#   ./scripts/run-selftests.sh --list    print what it would run, one per line
#
# Exit codes -- a consumer writes the condition as `rc = 0`, never "not 1":
#
#   0  every self-test passed and proved a red case
#   1  one of them failed, or ran no case, or proved no red case
#   2  cannot measure: no self-tests found, an interpreter is missing, an
#      unknown extension, or a self-test itself said it could not judge
