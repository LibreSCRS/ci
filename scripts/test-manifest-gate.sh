# test-manifest-gate.sh — compare the set of tests a build directory discovered
# against a list committed beside it.
#
# ctest reports whatever the build directory happened to discover, and that is
# not one number for one commit: different configurations of this project have
# reported 1791, 1883, 1889, 1961 and 1994 tests. A suite that quietly stops
# being registered therefore reads as success, and a test that moves between
# repositories can vanish while both sides stay green.
#
# One committed listing per CI leg is the smallest shape that can be compared.
# Removing a test stays allowed; it just has to be visible in the same change.
#
# Usage:
#   ci/scripts/test-manifest-gate.sh --check  <builddir> <leg>
#   ci/scripts/test-manifest-gate.sh --update <builddir> <leg>
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  the discovered set matches ci/test-manifest.<leg>.txt
#   1  it differs; the diff and a +N / -M summary are printed
#   2  refusing to judge: no manifest, ctest failed, an empty listing, or any
#      _NOT_BUILT entry. Those describe a build that did not happen, not a set
#      of tests, and a number this script cannot defend is worse than none.
