"""Self-test for dup-scan.py.

The scan's whole value is that it reports a twin nobody meant to keep and stays
quiet about the ones somebody did.  Both halves can fail silently: a
normalisation that never collides reports nothing over a tree of copies, and an
allowlist that swallows a group keeps swallowing it after the group stops being
identical.  Every case below is one of those.

Exit 0 when every case behaves; 1 otherwise, naming the cases that did not.
