# Selftest for check-tarball-determinism.sh. Six ways to build a tarball that
# is a fact about the machine rather than about the commit, plus the unmodified
# script as a control -- and one case where the script fails outright, because a
# check that reports success when it measured nothing is the vacuous kind.
#
# The fixture carries a tracked SYMLINK, because the mode arm shipped with a
# premise that was false for one ("a symlink is stored 777 by tar regardless of
# umask"): --mode rewrites it, and the arm refused the only tree in this stack
# that has one. The control case is what holds that premise to the measurement.
#
# The subject is run against a throwaway git repository holding a COPY of a
# real maker (fixtures/make-source-tarball.sh, LibreLinux's), which is what
# makes it perturbable at all. The makers stay in their repositories; this one
# is fixture data. The fixture's top directory is named LibreLinux, because the
# maker maps that name to the Debian source name and refuses one it does not
# know.
#
# GNU tar is required by the maker and by the subject. Where `tar` is not GNU
# (macOS), a shim directory puts gtar first on PATH as `tar`; without gtar the
# self-test cannot run and says so (exit 2).
#
# Each case asserts three things, because two are not enough:
#   * the perturbed script actually differs from the control (a perturbation
#     that changed nothing passes for the wrong reason);
#   * the exit code is the expected one;
#   * the named arm appears in the output. An exit code alone cannot tell a
#     refusal that worked from a refusal that fired on something else.
#
# /var/tmp, never /tmp, which is RAM on the maintainer machines.
