#
# The repository judged is the argument, else REPO_ROOT (default
# $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, then the git toplevel of the current directory) -- never
# this script's own location. Its maker is
# $REPO/${MAKE_SOURCE_TARBALL:-ci/scripts/make-source-tarball.sh}, which stays
# in each repository: the repositories' makers differ.
#
# The source tarball published with a release must be a function of the commit
# and of nothing else. Where the component carries an Arch recipe, that recipe
# holds the tarball's sha256 and a packager who rebuilds it has to get the same
# bytes back; where it does not, the tarball is still cosigned and listed in
# the signed SHA256SUMS beside the binaries, and anyone checking that manifest
# has to arrive at the same sum.
#
# Three separate facts about the machine used to leak into those bytes, and
# each of them survived for a different reason:
#
#   * every mtime came fresh from the clone, so two runs inside one second
#     agreed and two a second apart did not -- which is why a quick check
#     looked fine;
#   * owner and group were whoever ran the script;
#   * the MODE was the caller's umask. git clone honours it and tar records
#     what it finds, so the same commit tarred under umask 022 and under
#     umask 002 gave two different sums.
#
# So this does not compare two runs and stop there: a comparison alone is a
# coin toss on the wall clock, green whenever both runs land inside the same
# second. It forces a SECOND boundary and a UMASK boundary between the two
# runs, and then reads the property out of the archive itself -- every member
# carries `git log -1 --format=%ct` as its mtime, owner 0/0, and a mode from
# the closed set --mode writes; the members are in NAME order rather than the
# order readdir() happened to hand back; no member is under .github/, which the
# excludes silently failed to drop for as long as this script existed; and the
# top directory is <Repository>-<VERSION>, which is what the recipes cd into.
#
# The order arm is not redundant with the byte comparison, and that is the
# whole reason it is written out: two runs on ONE machine walk the tree in the
# same readdir() order, so dropping --sort=name leaves both runs identical and
# only a packager on another filesystem ever sees a different sum. Comparing
# the listing with `sort` would be wrong as well -- tar orders directory-wise,
# so a directory and a same-prefixed file interleave by depth rather than by
# byte: `a/c` precedes `a-b` because everything under `a/` sorts together,
# while plain strcmp puts `a-b` first because `-` (0x2D) sorts below `/`
# (0x2F). The selftest carries exactly that pair, `src/a-b` and `src/a/c`, and
# a plain `LC_ALL=C sort -c` calls it unsorted. The listing is compared
# against itself sorted with `/` mapped below every printable byte, which is
# exactly directory-wise order.
#
# What stays outside its reach is the compressor: gzip -9 output is a property
# of the gzip implementation, so the published sum is reproducible for anyone
# using the same one, not for everyone. (gzip is fed from a pipe, so it writes
# no name and a zero MTIME field either way.)
#
# Threat model. This runs the real script and measures the archive it produced,
# so it does not depend on the shape of the source text and cannot be talked
# out of a verdict by how the tar line is written. What it does not resist is a
# script that behaves differently for it than for a release: reading
# CI/GITHUB_ACTIONS, or the output directory's name, or the time of day. Nor
# does it see the release workflow -- that a workflow still builds and uploads
# the tarball at all is check-release-artifacts.sh's producer arm, not this
# one's. Code review, not this gate, catches a script written to mislead.
#
# Not every component that ships make-source-tarball.sh runs this check. Where
# the clone the maker makes is purely local it takes under a second; where a
# tree carries a submodule or cmake/FetchQCBOR.cmake, the same run fetches from
# a third-party host twice per check, and a gate that goes red because that
# host is unreachable teaches people to ignore red. The property is measured
# wherever the clone is purely local (a repository's profile says so), and
# stated as unmeasured in the release workflow of the rest.
#
# GNU tar is required: the listing below is GNU tar's, and so is every maker's
# --sort=name. TAR names it where `tar` is not GNU (macOS: gtar).
#
# Exit: 0 the tarball is a function of the commit - 1 it is not
#       2 nothing could be measured, which is NOT a pass.
