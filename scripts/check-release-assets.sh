# held true against that repository's ci/release-assets.txt.
#
#   --staged [<dir>]            before `gh release create`: the files in <dir>
#                               are exactly the declared set, both directions.
#                               No <dir> means "this release uploads no asset",
#                               and then the declaration must hold no glob.
#   --wired                     on push: the release workflow's job that runs
#                               `gh release create` runs `--staged` before it,
#                               in a step that can fail the job -- not behind
#                               continue-on-error, an if:, or a trailing ||.
#                               A step that `uses:` the shared release-publish
#                               action counts as both, in that order: the
#                               action runs --staged before it creates the
#                               release, and this same arm, pointed at the
#                               action's own file (RELEASE_WORKFLOW=
#                               actions/release-publish/action.yml), is what
#                               the self-test holds to that.
#   --published <tag>           after the release exists: its assets are the
#                               declared set. A draft is judged, and says so.
#   --published-strict <tag>    the same, and a draft is NOT judged (exit 2):
#                               the only form that is evidence of a release.
#
# It measures names handed to gh, not a model of the workflow. A static reading
# of release.yml would have to model every flatten step, and a step that later
# removes or adds a file would pass it; the staged directory is the bytes gh is
# about to publish. An entry in it that is a directory is named: gh refuses it.
#
# The declaration is one glob per line (fnmatch, against the asset NAME), two
# spaces, then the one-line description the downloads page renders. A file
# holding only comments is a claim -- "this repository publishes no asset" --
# and a missing file is not a claim at all.
#
# The consumer's tree is REPO_ROOT (default $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, then the git
# toplevel of the current directory) -- never this script's own location,
# which on a runner is the shared-gates checkout, not the repository judged.
#
# Inputs (for the self-test; CI uses the defaults):
#   RELEASE_ASSETS_FILE  default: $REPO_ROOT/ci/release-assets.txt
#   RELEASE_WORKFLOW     default: $REPO_ROOT/.github/workflows/release.yml;
#                        a composite action.yml is read the same way
#   GH_ASSETS_JSON       a file standing in for `gh release view --json`
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY    the repository `gh release view` asks about
#
# Exit codes -- a consumer writes the condition as `rc = 0`, never "not 1":
#   0  the sets agree (or the job is wired)
#   1  they do not: a name with no glob, a glob with no name, a directory in
#      staging, an empty staging against a non-empty declaration, or the
#      --staged step missing from or after the release step
#   2  nothing could be measured, which is NOT a pass: no declaration, a glob
#      declared twice, a staging directory that was promised and does not
#      exist, no `gh release create` in the workflow, no release to read, or a
#      draft under --published-strict
