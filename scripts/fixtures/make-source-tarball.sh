# it; it is never run against a real release.
# make-source-tarball.sh [output-directory]
#
# The tarball is named so that `<source>_<version>.orig.tar.gz` is what
# dpkg-source expects of an .orig. Neither build consumes it yet -- the deb
# build runs `dpkg-buildpackage -b`, which never touches an orig tarball, and
# the rpm build still rolls its own archive inline, under a different name and
# a different top directory than the spec's `Source0`/`%autosetup` expect.
# Today the one consumer is the Arch recipe, which fetches the published asset
# by URL.
#
# Two things this script refuses to do, both because they have already gone
# wrong once:
#
#  * `git archive` does not descend into submodules, and a tree without
#    thirdparty/curl-source fails configuration with "No download info given
#    for 'curl_external'". So the tree comes from a clone with
#    --recurse-submodules, with .git removed afterwards.
#
#  * `tar --exclude-vcs-ignores` honours every .gitignore in the tree. The
#    vendored OpenSC ignores *.[0-9] while tracking a man page that matches it,
#    and dropping that one file stopped its autotools build with a
#    missing-target error naming a file nobody deleted. Only explicit excludes —
#    anchored to the top directory, because an unanchored './x' matches no
#    member name tar ever writes here and excludes nothing at all.
#
# Any dependency that is fetched at configure time rather than carried as a
# submodule is vendored here, at its pinned commit, so the package build never
# reaches the network.

# The excludes are anchored to the top directory. './.github' matches NOTHING:
# tar's member names here are "<Repo>-<version>/.github/…", so an unanchored
# exclude drops nothing at all and the workflow files ship in the published
# tarball. check-tarball-determinism.sh fails on any member under .github/.
#
# `--sort=name` and everything below it are what make two runs produce the same
# bytes. Without them the sum in sha256sums is a fact about one upload and
# nothing else.
#
# --sort=name settles the member ORDER. Without it the order is whatever
# readdir() hands back, which is a property of the filesystem the clone landed
# on; with it the order is the names', sorted directory-wise, so `a/c` comes
# before `a-b` even though strcmp puts `a-b` first. Two runs on one machine
# agree either way, which is why order is the arm a byte comparison cannot see.
#
# Three further facts about the machine leaked into the bytes:
#
#  * every mtime was the moment of the clone, so two runs a second apart
#    differed (two inside one second did not, which is why this survived);
#  * owner and group were whoever ran it;
#  * the MODE was the caller's umask. git clone honours it and tar records what
#    it finds, so the same commit tarred under umask 022 and under umask 002
#    gives two different sums: one writes drwxr-xr-x/-rw-r--r--, the other
#    drwxrwxr-x/-rw-rw-r--. A packager rebuilding the tarball to check the
#    published sum would conclude the asset had been tampered with, which is
#    why check-tarball-determinism.sh runs this script under both umasks.
#    --mode normalises all three: 755 for anything executable or a directory,
#    644 for the rest. It reaches symlinks too, where the stored mode is a
#    constant either way: GNU tar stores lrwxrwxrwx without --mode and
#    lrwxr-xr-x with it. Neither is the umask, but only one of them is what
#    this script writes, and that is the one the check accepts.
#
# What remains outside this script's reach is the compressor: gzip -9 output is
# a property of the gzip implementation, so the sum is reproducible for anyone
# using the same one. (gzip is fed from a pipe, so it writes no name and a zero
# MTIME field of its own either way; -n says so rather than relying on it.)
